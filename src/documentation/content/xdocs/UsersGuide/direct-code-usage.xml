		<title>Including CILib within your own source</title>
		<p>
			CILib can asily be intergrated into your project without needing to
			specify an XML configuration file. The code must be called directly and
			built correctly in order to be used without an XML configutration. CILib does, however,
			create defaults so the algorithm should still be able to execute. It is up to the user
			to correctly build the type of algorithm required.

		<p>
			The following is a simple example on how to intergrate a gbest PSO within your
			project.
