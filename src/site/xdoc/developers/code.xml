    <p>
    This document describes how developers and contributors should write
    code to be included into the main CIlib tree. The reasoning behind
    these conventions is mainly for consistency, readability and
    maintainability.
    </p>

    <section name="General code style and convention">
    <p>
    All working files within the source tree of CIlib must adhere to the
    following conventions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>License Header</b>: All source files will add the GPLv2
      license header. NOTE: CIlib will <b>not</b> compile if the check
      for header information fails.</li>
      <li><b>Trailing whitespaces</b>: All trailing whitespaces must be
      removed.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Netbeans users should use the "Remove Trailing Whitespace"
	option under the "Source" menu item.</li>
        <li>Eclipse users can use the <a href="http://andrei.gmxhome.de/anyedit">Anyedit Eclipse Plugin</a> to automatically remove trailing whitespace.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Style conventions applying to the project:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Indentation</b>: No tabs are allowed for indentation! Use
      spaces.</li>
      <li><b>Line wrapping</b>: A column-width of 120 is to be used.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section name="Java code">
    <p>
    All classes are to be written following the <a
    href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/javabeans/docs/spec.html">JavaBeans Specification</a>, barring a special reason. Such reasons include the class being a Singleton or Helper class that is not required during the XML to Java binding process.
    </p>
    <p>
    The CIlib stype for Java source files is generally accepted to be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All class members are to be given names in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_caps">CamelCaps</a> (which is the accepted Java style).</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
  </body>
