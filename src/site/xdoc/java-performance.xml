			Many people often ask why was CIlib written in Java? Isn't Java too slow for scientific software?
		</p>
		<p>
			The following few links that might change your mind.

			<li><link href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-02-1998/jw-02-jperf_p.html">Performance tests show Java as fast as C++</link></li>
			<li><link href="http://kano.net/javabench/">Java is faster than C++</link></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Other reasons, apart from performance, for selecting Java as the language of implementation was due to
			the shear volume of available libraries and support for the language. Language features such as Reflection
			have proven to be invaluable.
