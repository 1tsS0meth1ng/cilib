    <p>
    CILib is composed as a collection of 5 hierarchies of component objects.
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Algorithm hierarchy</li>
    <li>Problem hierarchy</li>
    <li>Measurement hierarchy</li>
    <li>Control parameter hierarchy</li>
    <li>Type hierarchy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    CILib is a component based framework for Computational Intelligence 
    software, written in Java. CILib is a complex abstraction in order 
    to simply and effectively perform simulations and executions of 
    Computational Intelligence algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
    The design goals of CILib are to ensure simplicity in composing different
    algorithms, with performance of the algorithm not being as important as
    having an algorithmic framework that is highly generic and simplistic.
    The power of CILib lies in the ability to compose the required 
    algorithm quickly and	correctly from the available set of algorithmic
    components.
    </p>
    <p>
    All algorithm definitions are defined as a tree structure. As a result,
    the	use of XML leads to a very robust expression of the algorithm and the
    associated components.
    </p>

    <note>
    An algorithm need not be specified using XML. If the user would rather
    use the required classes directly, the user may do so. This will not 
    influence the operation of the algorithm or even the library.
