<p>
CILib is a framework for implementing various computational intelligence 
algorithms. The current version includes implementations for many particle swarm
optimisers, however, the framework is intended to be generic enough to
implement other computational intelligence algorithms such as neural networks 
(which can be used to solve classification and clustering problems), 
evolutionary algorithms (such as genetic and cultural evolutionary algorithms),
AIS (artificial immune systems) and in fact any algorithm falling within the  
computational intelligence paradigm.

<p>
In addition, CILib includes a simulator that can be used to execute and measure
the performance of any of the algorithms. The simulator is included primarily 
for academic purposes. All the algorithms are independent of the simulation 
engine so that they can be used in real world applications.
